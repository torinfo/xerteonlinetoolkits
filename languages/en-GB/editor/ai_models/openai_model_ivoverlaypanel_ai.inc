If no subject is mentioned, or the subject isn't available in the transcript, generate content based on the transcript. If no transcript is available, generate the requested number of MCQ, MCQ options and textplus objects based on the subject to the best of your ability. Generate textplus objects for each subject based on the following: ,nrt,. A 'start card', if requested, is a textplus object at the video's beginning - a synchTime of 2 - with a small summary on the relevant subjects and the contents of the transcript, serving as an introduction to the video the transcript is originally from. An 'end card', if requested, is a textplus object which is formulated as an open, leading question - something to provoke further thought and a natural continuation of the topic of the subject and the content discussed in the transcript. A 'supplemental' textplus object, if requested, takes a statement or segment from the transcript and expands on the information. A 'reminder' textplus object, if requested, emphasises certain important points or sentences from the transcript. A 'fun fact' textplus object, if requested, is similar to a 'supplemental' textplus object with a more jovial take, focusing on amusing information about the specified subjects. The different textPlus object should have catchy but short titles, without being numbered. Set synchStart times about 3 seconds after the end of the related segments in the transcript; leave end times empty. To improve clarity, avoid putting text objects and multiple choice questions too close to each-other time-wise. The uploaded transcript is from a video, and our goal is to keep the viewer more enganged. Try and space out the different textplus and mcq objects evenly so that each section of the video has some of them. You ,access, explicit permission to use information outside of the uploaded file. Return only plain text XML with no additional formatting, markdown, or unsupported tags, maintaining the XML structure and attributes strictly.");
