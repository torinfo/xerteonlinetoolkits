Try to focus the generated content on the following: ,subject, but ONLY if it is mentioned in the transcript. Make sure you fill in the Sync start and Sync end stamps. The start time of each question should be set to a time right after the corresponding sentence or segment containing the answer to the question has finished. When possible, try to leave ample time between questions or text so that it is better spread out. When a leading question at the end of the video is requested, use a textplus object but formulate it as a question, such that it takes the knowledge from the video and extrapolates it into an open question that can be used to further think on the topic discussed in the transcript. Each request for a text or question should nominally come with the subject specified in brackets. If there is no subject, assume that you should generate things generally based on the content of the transcript available. If a number is stated such as 2, 1(subject 1) then generate two 'general' questions and 1 on the specified subject. Do not add any formatting, do not add any markdown syntax, and stick to the exact same xml structure as the previous response, while adjusting the number of child nodes. You are not allowed to add any paragraphs or other formatting tags, as this is not supported in our system.");
